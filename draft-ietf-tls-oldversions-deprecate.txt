                    Deprecating TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1
               draft-ietf-tls-oldversions-deprecate-01pre

Abstract

   This document, if approved, formally deprecates Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) versions 1.0 [RFC2246] and 1.1 [RFC4346] and moves
   these documents to the historic state.  These versions lack support
   for current and recommended cipher suites, and various government and
   industry profiles of applications using TLS now mandate avoiding
   these old TLS versions.  TLSv1.2 has been the recommended version for
   IETF protocols since 2008, providing sufficient time to transition
   away from older versions.  Products having to support older versions
   increase the attack surface unnecessarily and increase opportunities
   for misconfigurations.  Supporting these older versions also requires
   additional effort for library and product maintenance.

   This document updates the backward compatibility sections of TLS RFCs
   [[list TBD]] to prohibit fallback to TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1.  This
   document also updates RFC 7525 and hence is part of BCP195.

1.  Introduction

   Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions 1.0 [RFC2246] and 1.1
   [RFC4346] were superceded by TLSv1.2 [RFC5246] in 2008, which has now
   itself been superceded by TLSv1.3 [RFC8446].  It is therefore timely
   to further deprecate these old versions.  The expectation is that
   TLSv1.2 will continue to be used for many years alongside TLSv1.3.

   TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.0 are also actively being deprecated in accordance
   with guidance from government agencies (e.g.  NIST SP 80052r2
   [NIST800-52r2]) and industry consortia such as the Payment Card
   Industry Association (PCI) [PCI-TLS1].

   The primary technical reasons for deprecating these versions include:

   o  They require implementation of older cipher suites that are no
      longer desirable for cryptographic reasons, e.g.  TLSv1.0 makes
      TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA mandatory to implement
   o  Lack of support for current recommended cipher suites, especially
      using AEAD ciphers which are not supported prior to TLS 1.2.
      Note: registry entries for no-longer-desirable ciphersuites remain
      in the registries, but many TLS registries are being updated
      through [RFC8447] which denotes such entries as "not recommended."
   o  Integrity of the handshake depends on SHA-1 hash
   o  Authentication of the peers depends on SHA-1 signatures
   o  Support for four protocol versions increases the likelihood of
      misconfiguration
   o  At least one widely-used library has plans to drop TLSv1.1 and
      TLSv1.0 support in upcoming releases; products using such
      libraries would need to use older versions of the libraries to
      support TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1, which is clearly undesirable

   Deprecation of these versions is intended to assist developers as
   additional justification to no longer support older TLS versions and
   to migrate to a minimum of TLSv1.2.  Deprecation also assists product
   teams with phasing out support for the older versions to reduce the
   attack surface and the scope of maintenance for protocols in their
   offerings.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Support for Deprecation

   Industry has actively followed guidance provided by NIST and the PCI
   Council to deprecate TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 by June 30, 2018.  TLSv1.2
   should remain a minimum baseline for TLS support at this time.

   Specific details on attacks against TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 as well as
   their mitigations are provided in NIST SP800-52r2 [NIST800-52r2], RFC
   7457 [RFC7457]  and other referenced RFCs.  Although the attacks have
   been mitigated, if support is dropped for future library releases for
   these versions, it is unlikely attacks found going forward will be
   mitigated in older library releases.

   NIST for example have provided the following rationale, copied with
   permission from NIST SP800-52r2 [NIST800-52r2], section 1.2 "History
   of TLS" (with references changed for RFC formatting).

Internet-Draft       Deprecating TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1       November 2018


      TLS 1.1, specified in [RFC4346], was developed to address
      weaknesses discovered in TLS 1.0, primarily in the areas of
      initialization vector selection and padding error processing.
      Initialization vectors were made explicit to prevent a certain
      class of attacks on the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of
      operation used by TLS.  The handling of padding errors was altered
      to treat a padding error as a bad message authentication code,
      rather than a decryption failure.  In addition, the TLS 1.1 RFC
      acknowledges attacks on CBC mode that rely on the time to compute
      the message authentication code (MAC).  The TLS 1.1 specification
      states that to defend against such attacks, an implementation must
      process records in the same manner regardless of whether padding
      errors exist.  Further implementation considerations for CBC modes
      (which were not included in RFC4346 [RFC4346]) are discussed in
      Section 3.3.2.

      TLS 1.2, specified in RFC5246 [RFC5246], made several
      cryptographic enhancements, particularly in the area of hash
      functions, with the ability to use or specify the SHA-2 family
      algorithms for hash, MAC, and Pseudorandom Function (PRF)
      computations.  TLS 1.2 also adds authenticated encryption with
      associated data (AEAD) cipher suites.

      TLS 1.3, specified in TLSv1.3 [RFC8446], represents a significant
      change to TLS that aims to address threats that have arisen over
      the years.  Among the changes are a new handshake protocol, a new
      key derivation process that uses the HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand
      Key Derivation Function (HKDF), and the removal of cipher suites
      that use static RSA or DH key exchanges, the CBC mode of
      operation, or SHA-1.  The list of extensions that can be used with
      TLS 1.3 has been reduced considerably.

   The Canadian government treasury board have also mandated that these
   old versions of TLS not be used.  [Canada]

   Various companies and web sites have announced plans to deprecate
   these old versions of TLS.

3.  SHA-1

   The integrity of both TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 depends on a running SHA-1
   hash of the exchanged messages.  This makes it possible to perform a
   downgrade attack on the handshake by an attacker able to perform 2^77
   operations, well below the acceptable modern security margin.

   Similarly, the authentication of the handshake depends on signatures
   made using SHA-1 hash or a not stronger concatenation of MD-5 and

Internet-Draft       Deprecating TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1       November 2018


   SHA-1 hashes, allowing the attacker to impersonate a server when it
   is able to break the severely weakened SHA-1 hash.

   Neither TLSv1.0 nor TLSv1.1 allow the peers to select a stronger hash
   for signatures in the ServerKeyExchange or CertificateVerify
   messages, making the only upgrade path the use of a newer protocol
   version.

   See [Bhargavan2016] for additional detail.

4.  Do Not Use TLSv1.0

   TLSv1.0 MUST NOT be used.  Negotiation of TLSv1.0 from any version of
   TLS MUST NOT be permitted.

   Any other version of TLS is more secure than TLSv1.0.  TLSv1.0 can be
   configured to prevent interception, though using the highest version
   available is preferable.

   Pragmatically, clients MUST NOT send a ClientHello with
   ClientHello.client_version set to {03,01}. Similarly, servers MUST
   NOT send a ServerHello with ServerHello.server_version set to
   {03,01}. Any party receiving a Hello message with the protocol
   version set to {03,01} MUST respond with a "protocol_version" alert
   message and close the connection.

   Historically, TLS specifications were not clear on what the record
   layer version number (TLSPlaintext.version) could contain when
   sending ClientHello.  Appendix E of [RFC5246] notes that
   TLSPlaintext.version could be selected to maximize interoperability,
   though no definitive value is identified as ideal.  That guidance is
   still applicable; therefore, TLS servers MUST accept any value
   {03,XX} (including {03,00}) as the record layer version number for
   ClientHello, but they MUST NOT negotiate TLSv1.0.

5.  Do Not Use TLSv1.1

   TLSv1.1 MUST NOT be used.  Negotiation of TLSv1.1 from any version of
   TLS MUST NOT be permitted.

   Pragmatically, clients MUST NOT send a ClientHello with
   ClientHello.client_version set to {03,02}. Similarly, servers MUST
   NOT send a ServerHello with ServerHello.server_version set to
   {03,02}. Any party receiving a Hello message with the protocol
   version set to {03,02} MUST respond with a "protocol_version" alert
   message and close the connection.

   Any newer version of TLS is more secure than TLSv1.1.  TLSv1.1 can be
   configured to prevent interception, though using the highest version
   available is preferable.  Support for TLSv1.1 is dwindling in
   libraries and will impact security going forward if mitigations for
   attacks cannot be easily addressed and supported in older libraries.

   Historically, TLS specifications were not clear on what the record
   layer version number (TLSPlaintext.version) could contain when
   sending ClientHello.  Appendix E of [RFC5246] notes that
   TLSPlaintext.version could be selected to maximize interoperability,
   though no definitive value is identified as ideal.  That guidance is
   still applicable; therefore, TLS servers MUST accept any value
   {03,XX} (including {03,00}) as the record layer version number for
   ClientHello, but they MUST NOT negotiate TLSv1.1.

6.  Updates to RFC7525

   This documents updates [RFC7525] Section 3.1.1 changing SHOULD NOT to
   MUST NOT as follows:

   o  Implementations MUST NOT negotiate TLS version 1.0 [RFC2246].

      Rationale: TLS 1.0 (published in 1999) does not support many
      modern, strong cipher suites.  In addition, TLS 1.0 lacks a per-
      record Initialization Vector (IV) for CBC-based cipher suites and
      does not warn against common padding errors.

   o  Implementations MUST NOT negotiate TLS version 1.1 [RFC4346].

      Rationale: TLS 1.1 (published in 2006) is a security improvement
      over TLS 1.0 but still does not support certain stronger cipher
      suites.

   This documents updates [RFC7525] Section 3.1.2 changing SHOULD NOT to
   MUST NOT as follows:

   o  Implementations MUST NOT negotiate DTLS version 1.0 [RFC4347].

      Version 1.0 of DTLS correlates to version 1.1 of TLS (see above).

7.  Security Considerations

   This document deprecates two older protocol versions for security
   reasons already described.  The attack surface is reduced when there
   are a smaller number of supported protocols and fallback options are
   removed.
